Thanks for checking out my Todo App. Here is a brief explanation about the decisions I made doing this project:

I chose React for this project as it's what I have the most experience in using. I did consider learning Vue for this as have a Udemy course on Vue.js waiting for me to check it out, but I didn't feel there was a need to use Vue rather than React.

I didn't feel that Redux was necessary for this project as it's quite small and doesn't need to be particularly scalable. I used hooks and functional components throughout the app.

I did decide to learn one new thing through this process, and that was how to use Tailwindcss. It didn't have too much of a learning curve and I'm quite happy with how it turned out - a fairly clean design, but I think I only just scratched the surface with this library.

I implemented some animation but I removed it in the end, as I was unable to figure out a way of stopping it animating the list when doing the inline edit on any of the items. I thought it was better to remove it and have no animation at all, rather than having a really annoying animation that appears when using the app to do something that shouldn't cause too much of a visual distraction. 

I moved the submit section to the bottom of the app, mainly for the mobile view, as I thought this would improve user experience on a small screen when using thumbs.

Whilst creating this project I had to do a little bit of thinking to solve ordering the items by date with the checked items ordered by date above that but I found a way of making it work (if a little naive). I hadn't actually used a datepicker before, so that was another little problem that needed to be solved at the time.
